    <p>So, first thing first: <strong>NEVER</strong> water your plants on a schedule! <b>Know your plants</b>, check the soil, learn about their necessities, and <b>act accordingly</b>.</p>
    <p>Many plants are extremely sensitive to overwatering, and many to drought.</p>
    <p>The watering frequency reminder should be used to remind yourself that your plant exists, and to check whether it requires your attention or not.</p>
